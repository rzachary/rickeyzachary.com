## About Me

It is a pretty simple bio; I am a current Software Engineer, Researcher, and Writer;
consulting for a number of companies. I have formerly worked in the Public Sector
for a large number of Federal and Defense Agencies. Prior to that I worked for
private companies in the Data Science, Media, Finance, and Artifical Intelligence
domains.

## About My Site

I write on this site about a number of different topics but mostly about technology, fantasy sports,
gaming, and general topics. I write a lot of personal code since I am a Software Researcher, and use
that code and many of these writings for external publications and conferences.

I document my projects, presentations, conferences in a number fo various ways.

## Fantasy Sports

In addition to discussing normal technology, software, and general issues; I also use this site to 
talk about Fantasy Sports. Mostly Fantasy Football and Fantasy Baseball 
but I also write about all fantasy sports.


## Gaming

A topic I write about quite a lot is gaming, I specifically like to discuss Chess, Poker and Hearthstone. I
will write a lot about this particular topic and tag those writings with 'Gaming'.

## The Underview

I use [Jeykll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and it's default theme
[Minima Theme](https://github.com/jekyll/minima) to produce this
site. I made a few minor modifications to customize things for my work flow.

I write all the articles in eitehr VSCode or Vim and use code to publish
push it to GitHub. I am using AWS to host the site and use GitHub Actions to
deploy the site and new articles.
