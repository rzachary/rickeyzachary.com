It is a pretty simple bio; I am a current Software Engineer, Researcher, and Writer; consulting for a number of companies. I have formerly worked in the Public Sector for a large number of Federal and Defense agencies as a contractor. Prior to that I worked for private companies in the Data Science, Media, Finance, and Artifical Intelligence domains.

I use this site to write about a number of different topics but mostly about technology, fantasy sports, gaming, and general topics. I write a lot of personal code since I am a Software Researcher, and use that code and many of these writings for external publications and conferences. I document my projects, presentations, conferences in a number fo various ways.

Here are links to things I am working on at the moment: <br />
[Projects](https://github.com/rzachary) <br />
[Presentations](https://github.com/rzachary/presentations) <br />
[Conferences](https://conferences.rickeyzachary.com/list) <br />

In addition to discussing normal technology, software, and general issues; I also use this site to talk about fantasy sports. Mostly Fantasy Football and Fantasy Baseball but I also write about all fantasy sports. I will also from time to time talk about sports in general as various topics come up. A topic I write about quite a lot is gaming, I specifically like to discuss Chess, Poker and Hearthstone. I will write about this particular topic and tag those writings with 'Gaming'.

## The Underview

I use [Jeykll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and a modified version of it's default theme [Minima Theme](https://github.com/jekyll/minima) to produce this site. I made some modifications like adding in a Rakefile to add posts, drafts, and publish the blogs, some bash scripts to build locally and test; as well as a GitHub Action to provide build and deploy the blog to a static AWS S3 bucket. I write all the articles in Sublime Text 3 or Vim and use code to publish push it to GitHub. I have a service that I use to manage what conferences I have attended and what I will be attending which I publish off of AWS as well.

## Contacting Me
For whatever reason, people may want to contact me. I am one-hundred percent on board with being contacted and the best ways of doing so are usually digitally.
