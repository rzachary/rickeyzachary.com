I have wondered about my use of exclamation points in my writing, I have generally been told that I use too many of them we will find out. Thankfully I have decided to start writing again so this blog will document all of my posts, articles, and papers that I will produce. I have in the past written about a large and diverse set of topics. I have written about my main topic, software engineering and producing software products; but I have also written about gaming specifically chess and poker which I love to play; as well as fantasy sports and betting. I will continue to write about all of those topics as well as cultural issues like food, sneakers, television and any topics I think I need to discuss.

I am thinking about organizing this blog in two main ways categories and tags. Most of my categories will be series of things that, will be discussed. The major series I have in mind are The Ten, a set of articles where I discuss my ten favorite or most influential things in a collection (e.g. Ten favorite Albums, Shoes, Books)or just a discussion about ten items. I plan to do a few technology series going indepth on aspects of creating software, using technologies and how to improve writing software. Other series will come and go but I think those will be the primary mechanisms for collecting multiple posts that are a part of a theme or collection.

All of my other posts will be about all of my other interests, and I will try and write about 2-4 posts per week; it depends on my schedule and what I am doing at the time. My hope is that I write here enough that I have a recording of my thoughts and feeling and will have an overall better outlook on things.

Plus my greatest achievement will be converting my vices into something I can be proud of because, it is always great when your vices pay off.
