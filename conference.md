I have given a number of presentations at conferences about 
GitHub, Git, DevOps, Agile and Software Engineering in general.

I have listed my most recent conference speeches.

# Upcoming
I have avery good attendance rate at confeerences throughout the 
year. So I list the conferences I have on my upcoming schedule for the year
and outline which ones I plan on having giving presentation at or a 
speaking role in some capacity.


# Attended

The conferences listed are the last conferences I have 
attended. I have been putting up the last 5 conferences attended
here and have a service that lists the conference I have attended in the past.
