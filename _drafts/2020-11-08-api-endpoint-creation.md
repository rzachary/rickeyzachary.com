Over the course of my life as a software developer I have written a lot of APIs, in all sorts of languages and technologies. There are a lot of patterns that develop when developing apis of the course of a few years. Most of those types of patterns develop around rounting, composability, and observability. I find myself writing the same code or type of code no matter the language or technology I am using when creating APIs.
