# Introduction
The two areas I focus in on while developng software, are fast and easy; my idea is to make things faster and easier. It is a novel concept but truly harder to conceive than to implement in some instances. If you have ever started with a new company then most software engineers know that project startup and analyzing a code base takes a lot of mental engergy and cycles. While doing this at many different companies and on many different teams I realized that configuring new machines and environments is a slow and and difficult process. So how do you speed up that process for creating new development environments. One way has been utilizing Docker and Vagrant and otehr virtualization technologies, which expidite the delivery of development environments tremendously; however, those environments are bare bones and not customized to an individual software developer. So obviously this takes some time, to configure so that developers can be productive and work at their most efficient. 

Now if you are a programming in multiple languages, using multiple IDEs, and have various build environments like me you are constantly configuring and reconfiguring your machine to make sure things work. Even worse you could be swithcing machines depending on the project, service, or even feature which means you spend a little bit of upfront time making sure the machine is configured to your liking and is consistent. Normally I spend my time configuring a machine by installing packages and applications onto the machine and configuring things, digging through configuration files and making sure everything is correct on the mahcine, it is quite a chore. Thankfully in the files we are configuring we have found a way to shirk some resonsibility and automate the heck out of some of these configurations and installations.

# Enter Dotfiles
Within all operating systems  there are ways to configure attributes and seetings, to perform a set of consistent actions and persist them even beyond restart. In a Windows system those generally are performed with Registry Keys, a set of key value pairs where the key is an identifier relating to an applicaiton or system attribute. These are pretty complicated because they can be binary, hexadecimal, or text/string values, which makes configuraiton sometimes very complicated. However it is possible to configure these using automated mechanisms.

In Linux/Unix based systems there are a number of hidden files that work to configure various aspects of your operating system and applications. These hidden files start with a dot "." so they are called dotfiles. For a good portion of applications that are installed on a *NIX system there will be an accompanying dot file. So for an application like Vi/Vim there will be a dot file that holds configuraiton settings for Vim. 

# Dotfiles are a Dev's best friend
