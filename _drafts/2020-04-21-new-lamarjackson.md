Last year in fantasy football the best value per average draft position would have to have gone to Lamar Jackson. He was regularly drafted in the middle of the 8th round in 2019, yet was the highest scoring player overall in almost all formats.  

When I am constructing a team, every year I look at value being the overall theme of my team. Even if I loose badly if my team has great value at each position I know I did my job that year. What do I mean by value, I want to out perform the other teams every round; drafting players that will score more points than other players drafted in the same round. Lamar Jackson in 2019 was the epitome of thinking about value first. He provided draft felxiblity since he was usually selected with aa later average draft position, giving you the ability to select lots of more risky picks when assembling a team and knowning you would probably have a later QB selection who would clearly out performed his draft position. 

He only trailed Dalvin Cook and Christian McCaffery in commonality on teams winning their fantasy leagues.

This is a player we want to target in leagues, low adp and higher upside; but Lamar Jackson is not he person to target in the upcoming drafts.

# There will be blood... I mean regression
Lamar Jackson's season while incredible is a bit of an anomoly for a number of reasons. His rushing numbers are a bit high even for running QuarterBacks. If we take a look at the top rushing 



# The unfortunate case against Kyler Murray
This is not a don't draft Kyler Murray take, I am confident that Kyler Murray will be a Top 10 if not Top 5 QB this year. However this is an, "I probably won't be able to get Kyler Murray" kind of take. 

# Then will the real value pick please stand up?

This is going to be hard to get at first, but my current strategy is the same strategy every year. I am taking a QB late, every late. I will let everyone take Lamar Jackson, and Patrick Mahomes and even Kyler Murray in the 6th round because I have a sleeper guy. Let's take a quick look at a little triple scenario. 

86th Pick based on Cuurent ADP
Scenario A
Scenario B
Scenario C

This mystery player is Josh Allen my target for next year in most of my leagues at QB.

# So what does this mean for me?
Josh Allen will be the kind of player that teams that want to make the playoffs and ultimately win the league will want.
