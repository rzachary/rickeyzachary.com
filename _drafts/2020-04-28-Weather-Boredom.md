# What is the weather for today?
So I had been a religious Dark Skys user, I thought it was a great app and all of the features worked well out of the box with almost no configuration. Well Apple bought the application and the company and discontinued it on Android. This completely makes sense from an Apple prespective but doesn't help me as an Android user because my favorite weather app is gone. I went ahead and started testing other weather apps but never found one that I liked or had the set of features I was wanting. So I decided why not make my own weather application with the features that I was wanting, I thought it would be a good idea and I was wanting a bit of a project.

I thoguht that the easiest way to start this project would be to find out what the weather is for today for my current location.
