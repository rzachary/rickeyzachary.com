# Introduction
What are they, Evolutionary Architectures?

You need data to provide adaptability, we get that stimuli from Monitoring systems?

Are those enough to build systems that are evolvable?

No based on the definition you need a guiding light, fitness functions.

# Fitness Functions


# Why are fitness functions so hard to describe

I have yet to see detailed descriptions of fitness functions.

This is because they are so dependent on the architecture and tool set, so the environment dictates the guiding principles.

We

# Fitness by example

I have switched to writing a marjority of my fitness functions in Haskell, it is functional and mathematically expressive enough so that other develoeprs can understand the intent of the constraints and receive rich data.

Lets imagine an ordering and shipment system.


Fitness functions for this.
